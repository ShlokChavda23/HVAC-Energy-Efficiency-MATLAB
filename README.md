This program allows users to input specific building characteristics including insulation quality, desired indoor temperature, and thermal mass. 
It simulates the indoor temperature going up and down due to the outdoor temperature fluctuations and HVAC activity.
The simulationâ€™s results were validated by comparing them with our hand-calculated energy estimates over a one day period. 
These comparisons matched the accuracy of the model created by the code pretty accurately with a minimal percent error.
The program creates graphs of indoor and outdoor temperature trends and also the energy consumption for the corresponding HVAC strategy chosen. 
The scheduled approach showed the lowest energy consumption while maintaining the desired indoor temperature.
The results demonstrated the value of having a strategic HVAC schedule to reduce energy costs and environmental impacts.
